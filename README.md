# articuno

A new Flutter project to showcase my skill for an internship at Articuno. I have not used any library for the ui.

## How to run

run the main.dart on any platform.

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(const MyApp());
}
```
this method is responsible for running the application.


```dart
    int r = Random().nextInt(256);
    int g = Random().nextInt(256);
    int b = Random().nextInt(256);
    Color bgColor = Color.fromRGBO(r, g, b, 1);
```
this is written in initState that creates a random color everytime the container is instantiated.

## To run the app in your device

# go to the specified location
